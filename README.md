### Flappy SHS

> If you just want to play the game, download and install the **Setup.exe** file (only works for Windows).

#### *Flappy SHS* is a fun game created for my university's Object Oriented Programming Project
- Features include:
	1. Multiple Characters with special abilities (Superspeed, Superflipper, Supercheater)
	2. The ability to play/pause the game
- Object Oriented Principles added in the game:
	1. **Inheritance:** A base interface -> Player class -> Abilities -> Characters
	2. **Polymorphism:** Special abilities for each pair of characters
	3. **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation**
- Highscore filing with encryption is also implemented

- This was not a solo effort, but a group project done by three students, namely:
	1. Haris Ahmad
	2. Shahmeer Ather
	3. Saad Salman
- Hence, the game has the name *SHS!*
